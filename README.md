1- Pizza Sales: In this project, I analyzed data from 91 different brands to determine total orders and sales, as well as popular sizes and categories for their clients, as well as sales over year for each month and average sales for each portion of the day, among other things. 
2- Layoffs: There were a lot of layoffs in all big tech companies and a lot of medium and small companies in different industries in 2022 and 2023, so in this project, I analysed data about 400 companies to know total numbers of layoffs, top 10 and workforce percentage impacted in each company and industry, and a lot of other things.
